A mini project to extract curl from a failed request in playwright-js. Please make sure nodejs and npm are working in your system.

1. clone the project, unzip node-modules.zip
2. goto tests and run **npx playwright test --reporter=html**

for the more adventurous ones or in case the above steps do not work,
1. create a folder and run the command **npm init playwright**, select javascript and ignore browser installations
2. copy the folders called **tests** and **utils** from my project and replace the ones in the freshly created project
3. goto tests and run **npx playwright test --reporter=html**
